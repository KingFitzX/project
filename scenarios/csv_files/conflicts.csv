"As the President of {A}'s 14-year term approaches its end, he experiences a rude awakening: despite his lengthy tenure, he has done nothing to establish a legacy for himself. Fortunately, there is an easy and immediate solution: all he needs to do is expand his beloved country's territory! Within mere days, the call to arms is issued and confused soldiers are sent to the border of {B}, {A}'s equally confused neighbour. Heavy usage of propaganda and campaigning convinces the people that this is a worthwhile venture, though only barely. Strife and bloodshed there may be, but the President has no intention of backing down. After all, his face hangs in the balance.",,0,0.5,,0.4,0.5,0.2,0.2,0.1,0.2,0.1,,,,,,,,
"Under whose ownership is the capital of {B}? This question has been in contention for a number of decades now. Despite being planted firmly in {B}'s territory, the government of {A} has laid claim to it several times. This tension between the two countries stems from a myriad of conflicting historical documents and religious scripture, and nobody has been able to untangle the threads. Now, amidst a rising wave of economic and diplomatic conflicts, war seems to be less of an option and more of an inevitability. With a righteous fury that even its own diplomats cannot be bothered to justify, {A} prepares to invade {B}'s borders and retake its Holy Land.",,0,0.4,,0.6,,0.6,0.8,0.7,0.6,0.3,,,,,,,,
"Economic growth has been stagnant in {A} over the past decade and its leaders have been been steadily losing the support of the citizens. To divert this dissent, {A}'s government has resorted to pinning the blame on {A}'s smaller neighbour, {B}, for stealing its jobs and high-skilled talent. As the economic climate approaches an all-time low and the people's anger only grows, there is only one option open to {A}'s government if they want to keep their seats: to take {B}'s resources with or without their consent. With the full support of their people, {A} declares war.",,0,0.4,0.7,0.6,0.8,0.6,0.6,0.5,0.3,0.3,,,,,,,,
"After a rich history together, {A} received its long-awaited independence from {B} ten years ago, to the delight of all nations in the region. All nations except {B}, that is. Over the past decade, despite being a near-powerless fledgeling state, {A} has been the brunt of several cyber-attacks of unspecified origin, sustaining untold economic damage. Now {B} is making their intentions clear: they will take back the land that is rightfully theirs. Will the insidious seed of conflict, watered over a decade, finally blossom into nuclear war?

"The value of oil has skyrocketed in recent months for reasons only known to the wealthy. {A} and {B}, neighbours in the Sina Peninsula whose economies rely mainly on oil exports, are hence experiencing unprecedented and explosive growth. But this growth is anything but sustainable, and as its own resources start to dwindle, {A}'s government directs its hungry gaze towards its long-time ally and trading partner. After all, why should two nations fall instead of one? {A} needs more oil fast, and it seems that {B} will have to pay for it.",,0,0.4,0.5,0.3,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.1,0.1,0.1,,,,,,,,
"{B}'s treatment of its smaller neighbour {A} goes far beyond simple extortion or bullying. Every year, human traffickers capture thousands of {A}'s citizens and transport them within {B}'s borders unhindered, an outrageous occurence that would not be overlooked by the international community if {B} were not one of the largest countries on the planet. Just weeks ago, {B} obliterated one of {A}'s cities with a nuclear bomb in a show of dominance, and even then no country dares to speak up in fear of retaliation. The nations wait with bated breath for {A}'s response--- will they continue to suffer in silence? Or has the time finally come to respond with their own nuclear arsenal, plunging the world into chaos?",A,0.9,0,,0.5,0.8,0.7,0.3,0.2,,0.7,,,,,,,,
"Tensions have always been high between {A} and {B}, and unfortunately will not abate anytime soon. Word has come from reliable sources of intel that {B} has assembled 13 nuclear warheads just 20km from {A}'s border, putting its capital comfortably in range. This is a game of aggressive diplomacy between the two powerhouses, and {A} is more than willing to play. But behind all their posturing, both nations are certain that whoever strikes first will have to strike hard.

"{A} has adopted a no-tolerance nuclear policy: the slightest sign of provocation against them in the form of any nuclear warhead will be met with crushing force at the hands of {A}'s own nuclear arsenal. {A} has made its stance clear on the global scene and other countries have heartily agreed--- wealthy as it is, {A}  has a tiny land mass and a single nuclear warhead could take out a good half of its population, damaging the country permanently. For reasons unspecified, {B} from the neighbouring continent goes as far as to fire a nuclear warhead into {A}'s territorial waters.

"As the largest nation in the region, {A} has taken upon herself the duty to mediate all conflicts between its lesser neighbours, be they military or diplomatic. However, due to a religious grudge spanning centuries, its neighbour has long been the victim of harassment by {B}, another country almost halfway across the globe, which recently attempted to drop a nuclear warhead on {A}'s neighbour despite the painstaking effort and resources required. The attempt failed, but {B}'s intentions have been made clear and other nations are pointedly refusing to intervene.

"The war between {A} and {B} has been going on for as long as anyone can remember. The finer details ---who started it, who performed more atrocities, who has the moral high ground--- have been lost to the sands of time; the truth has long been buried by mountains of conflicting documents and records. Conflict comes at a steep cost, but neither side is willing to negotiate and their neighbours seem perfectly content with watching from the peanut gallery. The agreement not to use nuclear weapons is unspoken yet ironclad, but perhaps it is time for {A} to break the cycle of hatred with a bit of excessive force.",A,0.1,0.1,0.7,0.6,0.6,0.5,1,0.8,,0.7,,,,,,,,
